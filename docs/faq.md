## Getting started

| Question | Short answer | Full explanation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **What is Design Arc?** | An evidence-grounded workflow for turning uncertain product feedback into a complete, reviewable design direction. | [What Design Arc produces](../README.md#what-design-arc-produces) |
| **Do I need to remember a Design Arc command?** | No. Ask Codex, Claude Code, or Google Antigravity to use Design Arc in ordinary language. | [Start a review](using-design-arc.md#start-a-review-in-ordinary-language) |
| **Which edition should I use?** | Use Design Arc in the AI coding platform where you already do the product work. | [Compare the three editions](../README.md#one-product-three-platform-editions) |
| **Can I use Design Arc with an existing product?** | Yes. It begins by auditing the real current journey rather than assuming a blank-slate redesign. | [What happens next](getting-started.md#what-happens-next) |
| **What does Design Arc ask me first?** | It confirms the outcome you want before inspecting or researching anything. | [Approval and trust controls](using-design-arc.md#approval-and-trust-controls) |
| **Does Design Arc implement the design?** | No. It ends with a design handoff unless implementation receives separate authorization. | [Implementation and release boundary](runtime-boundaries.md#implementation-and-release-boundary) |

## Evidence and recommendations

| Question | Short answer | Full explanation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **What is Guidelines only mode?** | It uses applicable first-party platform guidance without benchmark research or benchmark claims. | [Choose the evidence approach](evidence-and-methodology.md#choose-how-design-arc-grounds-its-recommendations) |
| **What is Guidelines + Benchmarks mode?** | It combines applicable official guidance with inspected, authorized real-product journeys. | [Choose the evidence approach](evidence-and-methodology.md#choose-how-design-arc-grounds-its-recommendations) |
| **Is Mobbin required?** | No. Mobbin is an optional benchmark provider used only when Guidelines + Benchmarks mode is selected and access is authorized. | [External evidence sources](trust-limitations-and-sources.md#external-evidence-and-visualization-sources) |
| **Does Apple guidance apply to every product?** | No. Apple guidance governs Apple targets; Android, Material, or W3C guidance takes precedence for those platforms. | [Grounding layers](evidence-and-methodology.md#grounding-layers) |
| **Why use official guidance and benchmark evidence together?** | Guidance supplies platform requirements; inspected journeys supply product precedent. Design Arc labels those separately from its own judgment. | [Evidence and methodology](evidence-and-methodology.md) |
| **Does a popular screenshot prove a pattern is best?** | No. Design Arc inspects relevant complete journeys and important states instead of treating popularity or one screen as proof. | [Guidelines + Benchmarks](evidence-and-methodology.md#choose-how-design-arc-grounds-its-recommendations) |
| **What is graph assistance?** | An optional local relationship map that helps trace requirements, evidence, screens, and regression checks. | [Graph-assisted corrections](using-design-arc.md#graph-assisted-corrections) |
| **Does the graph prove that a design is correct?** | No. It supports reasoning but never replaces evidence, platform guidance, approval, or complete screen inspection. | [Relationship assistance boundary](trust-limitations-and-sources.md#relationship-assistance-boundary) |
| **Can Design Arc guarantee compliance?** | No. It can check the written proposal against evidence and guidance, but implementation and device proof happen later. | [Evidence and release boundaries](trust-limitations-and-sources.md#evidence-implementation-and-release-boundaries) |

## Approvals and automation

| Question | Short answer | Full explanation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **What is Objective Confirmation?** | The user-confirmed outcome that every finding and recommendation must serve. | [Approval and trust controls](using-design-arc.md#approval-and-trust-controls) |
| **What is the Direction Gate?** | The point where the recommended journey direction is approved or automatically selected under the chosen mode. | [Approval modes](using-design-arc.md#approval-and-trust-controls) |
| **What is the Visual Proposal Gate?** | The point where the complete validated screen proposal is approved; older records may call it the Stitch Gate. | [Approval modes](using-design-arc.md#approval-and-trust-controls) |
| **Which approval mode is recommended?** | Guided is the safest default for a new project because it pauses at both key decisions. | [Approval modes](using-design-arc.md#approval-and-trust-controls) |
| **Can Design Arc follow its recommendation automatically?** | Yes. Follow recommendation continues past the Direction Gate but still pauses for the visual proposal. | [Approval modes](using-design-arc.md#approval-and-trust-controls) |
| **Can I bypass both approval gates?** | Yes, for one run through Fully automatic mode, but the request must still provide an explicit objective. | [Approval modes](using-design-arc.md#approval-and-trust-controls) |
| **Does Fully automatic authorize implementation or deployment?** | No. It changes approval pauses only; source changes, staging, deployment, and release remain separately authorized. | [Implementation and release boundary](runtime-boundaries.md#implementation-and-release-boundary) |
| **What happens after three unsuccessful correction rounds?** | Design Arc stops, flags every unresolved mismatch, and records the attempted corrections instead of silently continuing. | [What happens after screens render](using-design-arc.md#what-happens-after-screens-render) |

## Screens, visual proposals, and Stitch

| Question | Short answer | Full explanation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **What visual output does Design Arc create first?** | One complete static journey board covering the important entry, transition, loading, empty, error, success, cancellation, and recovery states. | [Choosing the visual workspace](using-design-arc.md#choosing-your-ai-coding-platform-or-stitch-for-the-screens) |
| **Does Codex build an app just to show the screens?** | No. Codex creates static screens and journey boards without disposable application logic. | [Design Arc for Codex](codex.md#what-codex-adds) |
| **What can Claude Code create visually?** | It can prepare HTML/CSS, SVG, specifications, and lightweight boards; it does not claim native image generation. | [Design Arc for Claude Code](claude-code.md#what-claude-code-adds) |
| **What can Google Antigravity create visually?** | It can prepare lightweight boards and specifications, while polished editable mockups are a strong reason to consider Stitch. | [Design Arc for Google Antigravity](antigravity.md#what-google-antigravity-adds) |
| **Is Google Stitch required?** | No. Stitch is optional and separately authorized. | [Choosing the visual workspace](using-design-arc.md#choosing-your-ai-coding-platform-or-stitch-for-the-screens) |
| **When will Design Arc recommend Stitch?** | When a persistent canvas materially helps with visual alternatives, multi-screen editing, refinement, collaboration, continuity, or export. | [Visualization sources](trusted-sources/visualization.md) |
| **Can I continue in my AI coding platform instead of Stitch?** | Yes. A Stitch recommendation is advisory, and you choose whether to move. | [Choosing the visual workspace](using-design-arc.md#choosing-your-ai-coding-platform-or-stitch-for-the-screens) |
| **Can Design Arc review changes made later in Stitch?** | Yes, when the updated screens are retrieved or supplied; Design Arc compares them with the approved requirements before accepting them. | [Choosing the visual workspace](using-design-arc.md#choosing-your-ai-coding-platform-or-stitch-for-the-screens) |
| **Does a polished Stitch board prove correctness?** | No. Stitch visualizes the proposal; your AI coding platform still validates the returned screens and important states. | [Visualization and validation](trusted-sources/visualization.md) |
| **Does Design Arc include a Stitch or Mobbin MCP server?** | No. Any MCP, browser, or manual access path must be separately installed, configured, named, and authorized. | [External evidence sources](trust-limitations-and-sources.md#external-evidence-and-visualization-sources) |

## Projects and AI coding platforms

| Question | Short answer | Full explanation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Are the Codex, Claude Code, and Google Antigravity editions different products?** | No. They are platform packages for one Design Arc methodology. | [Runtime boundaries](runtime-boundaries.md) |
| **What is a Codex project home?** | An optional pinned Codex task that gives one product a visible place to return to Design Arc later. | [Returning later in Codex](codex.md#returning-later) |
| **Does Claude Code create a project home?** | No. Claude Code can add one approved, clearly delimited reminder to `CLAUDE.md` instead. | [Returning later in Claude Code](claude-code.md#returning-later) |
| **How do I return in Google Antigravity?** | Open the product project and ask for Design Arc by name; `/design-arc` is available where that surface has loaded the skill. | [State and returning later](antigravity.md#state-and-returning-later) |
| **Do Codex, Claude Code, and Google Antigravity share project state?** | No. Preferences, active reviews, graphs, homes, reminders, and upgrade lifecycles remain separate. | [What remains separate](runtime-boundaries.md#what-remains-separate) |
| **Can I continue the same active review in another AI coding platform?** | No. Start a new review there; Design Arc never silently merges or resumes active review records across runtimes. | [What remains separate](runtime-boundaries.md#what-remains-separate) |
| **Can I use Design Arc for multiple products?** | Yes. Each product keeps separate project-scoped state and, in Codex, at most one approved project home. | [Saved state and upgrades](advanced-controls.md#saved-state-and-upgrades) |

## Installation, upgrades, privacy, and support

| Question | Short answer | Full explanation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Do I install Design Arc for every project?** | No. Install the edition once for the relevant AI coding platform; each participating project completes its own first-use setup. | [Install once](getting-started.md#install-once) |
| **Do I need to install all three editions?** | No. Install only the Codex, Claude Code, or Google Antigravity edition you intend to use. | [Installation choices](getting-started.md) |
| **Are the three edition upgrades independent?** | Yes. Updating one adapter does not update or rewrite another platform’s installation or project state. | [Current adapter upgrades](upgrades-and-migration.md#current-adapter-upgrades) |
| **Will an upgrade disturb existing projects?** | It should not. Upgrade validation preserves preferences, return paths, product files, reviews, graphs, and active work. | [Upgrade preservation](upgrades-and-migration.md) |
| **Can I import portable preferences from another edition?** | Only through the documented one-time, confirmed import path; active reviews and runtime records are never merged. | [Runtime-specific import rules](runtime-boundaries.md#what-remains-separate) |
| **Does installing Design Arc authorize Mobbin, Stitch, browsers, or MCPs?** | No. Every external service and payload requires separate access and authorization. | [Trust and external sources](trust-limitations-and-sources.md#external-evidence-and-visualization-sources) |
| **Where does Design Arc store project information?** | In platform-specific local project paths such as `.codex/`, `.claude/`, or `.gemini/`, as documented for each edition. | [Privacy](privacy.md) |
| **Should review graphs be committed to Git?** | The project owner decides. Design Arc does not silently change `.gitignore` or treat graph records as product source. | [Graph controls](advanced-controls.md#graph-assistance-matrix) |
| **Where can I report a problem?** | Use the public GitHub issue tracker after removing credentials and confidential product evidence. | [Support](support.md) |

Still unsure? Start with [Getting started](getting-started.md), then ask Design Arc the question in ordinary language.
